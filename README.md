## The Task

An investment firm that is interested in investing in the Initial Public Offerings (IPO) in the Indian market. You have been hired as a data scientist to build a deep learning classification model to determine if there will be listing gains for the IPO.
A test accuracy of just **`75%`** with just **319** observations is encouraging but not good enough. With more observations and further tweaking, a much higher accuracy could be achieved.
